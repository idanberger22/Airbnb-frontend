AirBNB inspired, StayBNB is a responsive, end to end application that allows its registered users to:
* Search for a place to stay in during any dates available, by typing the general location/name of the stay in the top filter available from almost every page of the application.     
* In the "explore" page, users may furher filter their desired stay by price range, type of room and amenities available like kitchen or WIFI.  
* In the "host your home" page, any user may upload a stay for other users to reserve.  
* In the "host dashboard" page, any user who own a stay may view his/her guests reservations as well as interesting statistics like total income or average stay rating.     
* When a guest reserve a stay, the host gets a real time notification.  
* In order to enjoy the full experience, please sign up or simply click on the "demo user" button in the login section.
